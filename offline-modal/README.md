# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created for a blog post on [Stork's Nest](https://storksnestblog.wordpress.com/).

## Purpose

offline-modal is a simple implementation which aims to show how to mock addEventListener with React testing-library.
The project actually does not deliver any modal, but a blueprint to create one. Therefore, it does not contain any css implementation.

## How to run offline-modal
Clone the repository onto your machine
Install dependencies with 'npm install'
You can start the server with 'npm start'
Run 'npm run test' for unit testing.
